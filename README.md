# SocialDataScience Group 21

Welcome to the code repository for Group 21 of the Social Data Science course. This README offers a brief guide on navigating through our codebase.

Our repository consists of 7 Jupyter notebooks, labeled sequentially from 1 to 7. To simplify navigation, any CSV files or images generated by a particular Jupyter notebook will bear the same number as that notebook. This system ensures a cohesive and intuitive experience as you move through our work.

## Execution Order:
1. **1_BoligPortalen_data.ipynb** is our first notebook, focusing on data collection from Boligportalen. This code facilitates the scraping of rental prices along with structural data. As a result of our scraping, we generated a CSV file named 1_boligportalen.csv encompassing all harvested data. Moreover, this notebook yields another file, 1_Final_urls.csv, which holds the URLs for each apartment under our study.

*Note: We've adjusted the script for the sake of inspection, limiting the run to the first 20 pages on Boligportalen, rather than the comprehensive 960 pages. Output data is saved to a new CSV, ensuring the original dataset remains intact. If you wish to revert to the extensive scrape, simply adjust the iteration count back to 960 and rename the resulting CSV file accordingly.*

2. **2_Geospatial_data.ipynb** serves as our second notebook, dedicated to the collection of geospatial data via an API. The gathered geospatial information is then stored in the 2_Final_Geospatial_data.csv file.

3. **3_Data Cleaning - BoligPortalen.ipynb** is our third notebook, focusing on data cleaning. Within this notebook, we process the data sourced from 1_BoligPortalen_data.ipynb and consolidate our refined rental data into the 3_Final_Rental_data.csv file.

4. **4_Data_processing - Shortest_distance_calculation.ipynb** serves as our fourth notebook, focusing on outlier removal and distance calculations. It refines the rental dataset and computes distances between geospatial attributes and apartments. This results in a consolidated dataset, 4_Final_Data.csv, which includes both geospatial and rental information. Additionally, scatterplots are generated for visual inspection of the data. A distinct CSV file, 4_Map_Data.csv, is also created, laying the groundwork for subsequent map visualizations.

5. **5_Map_generation.ipynb** is our fith notebook. This notebook is used to create Maps showing the location of our appartments and our geospatial attributes. Additionally, it provides a visual representation of how the nearest distance from each apartment to its geospatial attributes is calculated.

6. **6_OLS.ipynb** serves as our sixth notebook where we compute our OLS model. 

7. **7_LASSO.ipynb** is our seventh notebook, dedicated to the execution of our LASSO model. It also visualizes the selection process of the optimal lambda value through four illustrative plots.
